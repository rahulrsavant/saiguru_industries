) What we need to implement (Concept / Menu Tree)
A) Rolled Metal Products (Top menu)

MetCalc’s rolled section list: Pipe, Angle, Rebar, Beam, Channel, Flat bar, Sheet, Square bar, Round bar.

1) Pipe

Pipe has subtypes: Round / Square / Rectangular.
Common inputs (by dimensions):

Material (metal/alloy) + density

Dimensions depend on subtype:

Round pipe: Outside diameter D (mm), wall thickness S (mm), length L (m)

Square pipe: side a (mm), wall S (mm), length L (m)

Rectangular pipe: sides a (mm), b (mm), wall S (mm), length L (m)
Outputs:

total weight (kg) and derived “per meter” style values on metcalc

2) Angle

Angle has: Equal leg / Unequal leg
Inputs:

Equal: leg width A, thickness t, (optionally radii if you want higher accuracy)

Unequal: legs a, b, thickness S

length L

3) Rebar

Inputs:

diameter D (mm)

length L (m)

4) Beam

Beam has multiple types (at least I-beam + T-beam).
Inputs vary, but generally:

height h, flange width b

web thickness S, flange thickness t

radii R/r (optional for precision)

length L

5) Channel

Channel has: Equal / Unequal.
Inputs:

height h, flange width b

thickness S and possibly t (if not equal to S)

radius R

length L

6) Flat bar

MetCalc calls it “Strip” (flat rectangular).
Inputs:

width b (mm)

thickness a (mm)

length L (m)

7) Sheet / Plate

Inputs: width a, thickness s, length (and often sheet length is another dimension)
In practice you’ll do:

thickness, width, length (3D rectangular volume)

8) Square bar

Inputs:

side a (mm)

length L (m)

9) Round bar

Inputs:

diameter d (mm)

length L (m)

B) Fasteners (Top menu)

Fasteners section: Bolt / Screw / Nut.

1) Bolt

Bolt types shown: Countersunk / Hex-head / Round-head
Common minimal inputs (metcalc style):

diameter D (mm)

length L (mm)

material/density
Outputs:

quantity by weight OR weight by quantity (metcalc supports both directions)

2) Screw

Screw types shown: Countersunk, Pan-head, Round-head, Socket screw
Inputs:

diameter D, length L

material/density
Outputs:

same “qty↔weight”

3) Nut

Nut page indicates many nut shapes; subtypes like Hex / Flanged / Cap exist.
Inputs vary by type, but “starter version” can begin with:

thread/diameter proxy (D)

across-flats / thickness (if you want better)

material/density
Outputs: qty↔weight
